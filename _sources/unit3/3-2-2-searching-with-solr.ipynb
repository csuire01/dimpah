    "A Solr index is available at the following address [http://solrserver](http://solrserver). Querying a Solr server can be done in multiple ways but the simplest one is to use a HTTP GET request with query string. This is a lot of technical terms just to say that we will create a URL pointing towards the Solr server and add some parameters to it. Parameters can be added to any URL this way: [https://www.example.com/page?param1=val1&param2=val2]().\n",
    "If one of the parameter should contain an array of values, you can just repeat the parameter for each value of the array: [https://www.example.com/page?param1=val1&param1=val2](). Be careful that passing arrays as query parameters is not standardised, and other services may not work the same way (but Solr does !).\n",

    "Solr can support different set of parameters, each set corresponds to a different way of expressing queries. The following parameters are common to all available query parsers.\n",
    "- **defType:** *(default: lucene)* allows you to select which query parser Solr should use when processing your query. You can choose betwen *lucene*, *dismax* or *edismax*.\n",
    "- **sort:** *(default: score desc)* allows you to select how Solr will sort the results of your query. The syntax is as follows: `<field> <order>`, where `<field>` is the field over which you want to sort the results and `<order>` is *asc* for ascending or *desc* for descending. The default value will present documents in the descending order of their relevancy score.\n",
    "- **rows:** *(default: 10)* how many results will be returned by Solr. A search can return many results and it is not always desirable to display all of them at once. This parameter will limit the amount of documents returned by the search.\n",
    "- **start:** *(default: 0)* is used to specify an offset in the results list. Solr will display documents from this offset onwards. This parameter can be used in conjunction with the **rows** parameter to setup the paging of results. If the **rows** parameter is set to 10 (the default value), the first page of results can be displayed by setting **start** to 0. You can then get the second page by issuing the same request but setting the **start** parameter to 10, the second page by setting it to 20, *etc*.\n",
    "- **fl:** *(default: &ast;)* this parameter instructs Solr on which field shouyld be returned for every document. The default value returns every fields. You can set it to a space-separated list of fields.\n",
    "- **fq:** can be used to filter the documents returned after a query. The value of this parameter is in the form `<field>:<value or range>`. For example, setting this to `year:1950` will only return documents from this specific year ; setting it with a range can be done like this `year:[1900 TO 1910]`.\n",

Terms can either be single words like `fox` or `president`, or they can be phrases which are a group of words surrounded by double quotes like `\"green plant\"`. Several terms modifiers can be used to modify a search.\n",
    "- **Wildcard:** these can only be applied to single terms and not phrases. They add flexibility to the search by matching one character (using `?`) or several characters (using `*`). For example, the query `te?t` will match both `test` and `text`. The query `presi*` will match `president`, `presidential`, `presiding`, *etc*.\n",
    "- **Fuzzy search:** this is based on the edit distance algorithm. The system will match words that are similar to the query term, even if it is not an exact match. For example, the query `roam~` will match words like `foam` or `road`. By default, all words with an edit disyance of 2 will match the query word.\n",
    "- **Proximity search:** this type of search will look for words that are separated by a certain amount of different words. For example, the query `\"battle france\"~10` will match documents containing those two words separated by 10 other words at most.\n",
    "- **Boosting terms:** it is possible to control the relevancy of resulting documents by assigning a boost factor to the terms of your query. For example, the query `green^3 apple` will match documents containg those two terms, but document containing the term `green` will have a higher relevancy. The boost factor can also be set between 0 and 1 to lesser the relevancy of a particular term.\n",

This parser prevents using the wildcard term modifier but allows for more control by defining more parameters.\n",
    "- **qf:** stands for \"query fields\". It allow you to specify which fields will be searched and how important they are. This can be useful for if you have several textual field but one of them should be given more importance? Imagine our documents contain a title, a content and a comment. In this case, the qf parameter could be set like this: `title^2 content comment^0.5`, giving matches in the title field twice the importance than matches in the content of a document, while matches in a comment are twice less important that matches in the content. It is to be noted that modifying this parameter will not modify which documents are returned but will indeed modify their relevancy score and the order they are returned.\n",
    "- **mm:** stands for \"minimum should match\". By default, terms in a query are all optionals (even though at least one term should be present for a document to match). You can modify this value using integers or percentage. For example, setting it to `3` means that at least 3 terms in the query should be present in a document for it to match. Another example: `50%` means that at least half of the terms in the query should be present in a document fot it to match. You can also set this value as a negative integer or percentage. For example, setting this parameter to `-25%` means that up to a quarter of the terms in the query may be missing in resulting documents.\n",
    "- **pf and ps:** corresponds to *phrase field* and *phrase slop*. It is very similar to the proximity search, but allows for more flexibility. In a sense, it allows to treat the entire content of the `q` parameter as a phrase without using quotes. The fields concerned by this need to be set in the *pf* paramters, while the *ps* parameter is set to an integer indicating how much a token needs to be moved to match a phrase.\n",
