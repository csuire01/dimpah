# Digital Historical Research on European Historical Newspapers with the NewsEye Platform



Focused on historical newspapers, the richest historical records of their time, this course consists of two parts. First, you will receive knowledge on the challenges and biases in the use and analysis of large collections of digitised historical documents, with contents tailored to both CS and non-CS students. Then, all students will form interdisciplinary groups, for hands-on projects in digital humanities, jointly exploring research questions in teams formed of humanities and computer science students. Students will effectively learn how much they can benefit from each otherâ€™s skills, and for instance gain an understanding of the grey areas of search (e.g., due to misrepresented documents), and of the various blackboxes that typically are artificial intelligence methods.
