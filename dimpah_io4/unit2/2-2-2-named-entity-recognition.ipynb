    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) task aims at identifying real-world entities, such as names of people, organizations, and locations within historical documents. The term of *named entity (NE)*, widely used in Information Extraction (IE) or other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, was born in the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) which influenced the IE research between 1988 and 1996. Since 1999, the yearly conference on\n",

Knowing these relevant information may help in automatically categorizing the articles in defined hierarchies and enable smooth content discovery.

As the amount of digitized data accumulates, tools for harvesting the data are needed to gather information. Tools like NER can be extremely valuable to researchers, historians, or librarians for adding structure to the volumes of unstructured data and for improving access to the historical digitized collections.  For example, a simple keyword search can already provide a historian with a sense of whether a collection contains material relevant for their research, thus saving many hours of visiting archives and skimming through pages. NER task can be used to detect person names and locations, these entities having an equally significant presence in the news domain, in which people are often at the core of the events reported in articles.

    "\n",
    "An online journal or conference publication site could hold millions of research papers and scholarly articles. There can be hundreds of papers on a single topic with slight modifications. Organizing all this data in a well-structured manner can be complex. Segregating the papers on the basis of the relevant entities it holds can save the trouble of going through the plethora of information on the subject matter. For instance, if the articles have in their metadata different types of entities (for example, NER can detect fields of study as *Named Entity Recognition* and *Information Extraction*), one can quickly find the articles where the use of *named entity recognition in historical documents* is discussed."
