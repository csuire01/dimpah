    "Named entity recognition (NER) task aims at identifying real-world entities, such as names of people, organizations, and locations within historical documents. The term of *named entity (NE)*, widely used in Information Extraction (IE) or other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, was born in the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) which influenced the IE research between 1988 and 1996. Since 1999, the yearly conference on\n",

As the amount of digitized data accumulates, tools for harvesting the data are needed to gather information. Tools like NER can be extremely valuable to researchers, historians, or librarians for adding structure to the volumes of unstructured data and for improving access to the historical digitized collections.  For example, a simple keyword search can already provide a historian with a sense of whether a collection contains material relevant for their research, thus saving many hours of visiting archives and skimming through pages. NER task can be used to detect person names and locations, these entities having an equally significant presence in the news domain, in which people are often at the core of the events reported in articles. For exampl, the EU's digital platform for cultural heritage, [Europeana](http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/named-entity-recognition-for-digitised-newspapers/), is using NER to make historical newspapers searchable."

    "\n",
    "An online journal or conference publication site could hold millions of research papers and scholarly articles. There can be hundreds of papers on a single topic with slight modifications. Organizing all this data in a well-structured manner can be complex. Segregating the papers on the basis of the relevant entities it holds can save the trouble of going through the plethora of information on the subject matter. For instance, if the articles have in their metadata different types of entities (for example, NER can detect fields of study as *Named Entity Recognition* and *Information Extraction*), one can quickly find the articles where the use of *named entity recognition in historical documents* is discussed. This, NER could enable students and researchers to find relevant material faster by summarizing papers and archive material and highlighting key terms, topics, and themes."

    "\n",
    "- **Training dataset**: The actual dataset that we use to train the model. The model sees and learns from this data.\n",
    "- **Validation dataset**: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while training (*tuning model hyperparameters*). The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration. The validation set is used to evaluate a given model, but this is for frequent evaluation. The validation set is also known as the Dev set or the Development set. This makes sense since this dataset helps during the *development* stage of the model.\n",
    "- **Test dataset**: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset. The Test dataset provides the gold standard used to evaluate the model. It is only used once a model is completely trained (using the train and validation sets). The test set is generally what is used to evaluate competing models. Many times the validation set is used as the test set, but it is not good practice. The test set is generally well curated. It contains carefully sampled data that spans the various classes that the model would face, when used in the real world.\n",

For example, a training set with the size of 0.67 (67 percent) means that the remainder percentage 0.33 (33 percent) is assigned to the test set.\n",

    "text = \"In 1991 cholera appeared unexpectedly and without explanation in Peru, on the western coast of South America, where it had been absent for 100 years. Cholera caused 3,000 deaths in Peru the first year, and it soon infected Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and Chile and leaped northward to Central America and Mexico. By 2005 cholera had been reported in nearly 120 countries. Although the seventh pandemic continued in many parts of the world, the more-industrialized countries of the world were largely spared. As the disparity between industrialized and less-developed countries grew, cholera, which previously had been a global disease, seemed to have become yet another burden to be borne by impoverished nations of the Third World. Moreover, experts predicted that this time cholera would not go away but would become endemic to many parts of the world, much as it has been for centuries to the Ganges delta.\""
