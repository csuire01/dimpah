# 1.2.1. From Paper to Digital

We have seen that the digitization of historical newspapers is a great asset for research and for the digital humanities. We also know that powerful and efficient tools are available. But is it enough?

The answer is definitely no!

The process that leads to the availability of text extracted from historical newspapers is a very complex one that requires many processing steps. At each stage of this process, scientific, methodological or technical problems may arise. In most cases, you do not know what process the data has undergone and you are therefore faced with a black box problem.

In order to be able to analyze historical newspapers while guaranteeing a high level of the results, it is essential to understand the nature of the process undergone by the data and their impact on your research.


When we mention the potential biases that exist when using digitized historical newspaper data, we immediately think of the well-known problem of OCR. We will come back to this. Nevertheless, other problems arise before this stage. The first is related to an observation that is still valid today: not everything is digitized!

In a 2013 [article](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/11748), whose conclusions remain valid, Canadian historian Ian Milligan made the following observation:

"It all seems so orderly and comprehensive. Instead of firing up the microfilm reader to navigate the Globe and Mail or the Toronto Star, one needs only to log into online newspaper databases. A keyword search, for a particular event, person, or cultural phenomenon, brings up a list of research findings. Previously impossible research projects can now be attempted. This process has fundamentally reshaped Canadian historical scholarship. We can see this in Canadian history dissertations. In 1998, a year with 67 dissertations, the Toronto Star was cited 74 times. However it was cited 753 times in 2010, a year with 69 dissertations. "


It is clear that the online availability of historical newspapers is favouring their use in scientific publications. Instinctively, this does not raise any problem, yet the author draws two conclusions from his work:

"Firstly, online historical databases have profoundly shaped Canadian historiography. In a shift that is rarely – if ever – made explicit, Canadian historians have profoundly reacted to the availability of online databases. Secondly, historians need to understand how OCR works, in order to bring a level of methodological rigor to their work that use these sources."

*Exercise: read this article, list the reasons and explain why the author draws these conclusions.*
