# 1.1.2. What can be done with Digitized Newspapers ?

Treating the digitized historical newspapers as data allows us to renew our point of view on many historical research questions. On specific subjects, it also makes possible studies requiring by nature a great number of sources, in a reasonable time. As an example, we propose the reading of two articles on very different subjects that both use the digitized historical newspapers as data. 

Firstly, on the theme of gender, this blog post focuses in newspaper advertisements : [https://blogs.helsinki.fi/digital-humanities-hackathon/2019/05/23/130/](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/digital-humanities-hackathon/2019/05/23/130/)


Secondly, on the topic of return from migration, Dr. Sarah Oberbichler shows the benefits of large-scale access to old press data and the usefulness of powerful processing tools.

*Exercise: Read these two studies and propose a classification of the difficulties expressed by the authors (methodological problems, technological problems, ...) and the tools or methods used to overcome them.*


At the end of this course, you will also be able, as a team, to manipulate the corpus construction tools, the text analysis tools and the NewsEye platform. Whether you are a computer scientist, a historian, or a political science student, you will be able to work on any subject that interests you and exploit the potential of the digitized historical newspapers.
