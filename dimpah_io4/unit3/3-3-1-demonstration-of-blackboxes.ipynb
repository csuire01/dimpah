    "# 1. Demonstration of blackboxes\n",
    "To fulfill an information need, users have to interact with autonomous systems like the search engine of a digital ibrary. They have to express their information need in a way that is compatible with the system. This is not always easy and the available tools are far from perfect. There is a semantic gap between the way humans understand and process information and the way the machine does. We are not yet able to create the perfect user interface and we have to use imperfect ones. Unfortunately, this is the best we have so far and we must learn to understand the biases generated by such interfaces. The main methodological difficulty is to be aware of what is called **black boxes**.\n",

    "Black boxes describe systems where only the inputs and outputs are known. The internal mechanics are hidden from the user. In the context of a digital library, this can make it difficult to understand *why* some documents were returned after a query while others were not. There are several aspects of digital libraries that can creates such problem."

    "## a. OCR quality\n",
    "A lot of documents indexed inside digital libraries are not natively digital. Some transformations need to be operated before a system can ingest them and make them available to search. This is the case of most historical documents. At first, a document must be scanned to get a digital image that can be procesed. However, an image is just pixels without any semantic meaning. It is thus necessary to transform those pixels into characters that can more easily be manipulated by computers. This step is called optical character recognition (OCR). There have been great progress in the creation of algorithms able to do that. However, a lot of historical documents are not of a great quality, which will impact the quality of the extracted text. An example of these problems can be seen in the following image.\n",

    "\n",
    "The result of this process can create imperfect texts that will nonetheless be indexed in the system as is. This can create problems like a query not returning a particular document because the indexed text was not the one actually present in the document."

    "## b. Segmentation quality\n",
    "Depending on the documents you want to index and on what you want to make available for users, it may be necessary to segment them. This is the case for newspapers for example. After a query, most users would want to find relevant **articles**. It is of course useful to know in which issue certain terms appear but knowing in which articles of this issue they appear is much more interesting. Segmenting articles from a newspaper is a complex problem that is not yet solved. Thus, the segmentation is not perfect and it can lead to difficulties to retrieve pertinent articles after a search."

    "## c. Ranking problems\n",
    "After a query in a digital library, the system returns a list of documents deemed relevant. By default in most systems, those documents are ordered by their estimated relevancy. This relevancy can be computed in different manners depending on how the search engine has been configured. However, this information is often hidden to the users. It is then sometimes difficult to understand *why* a document has been scored higher than other. Most search system compute the relevancy of a document towards a query based on three aspects:\n",
    " - the frequency of the query terms in the document\n",
    " - the frequency of those terms in the entire corpora\n",
    " - the length of the document\n",
    "The score of a document will be the highest if the query terms are very frequent in this document but not in the entire collection, and if the document is small."

    "## d. Difference between accessibility and availability\n",
    "Indexing documents in a digital library makes them **available** to the users. However, they may not all be **accessible**. A lot of automatic processes can degrade the quality of the indexed documents and the search system itself is not always transparent on how the returned documents were chosen after a user query. Most of the time, users don't have a say on how a search system is developed. Thus, it is important to be aware of the different biases inherent to digital libraries to take them into account when gathering documents for a corpus."
